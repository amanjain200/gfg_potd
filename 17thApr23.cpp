Given a set of N jobs where each jobi has a deadline and profit associated with it. Each job takes 1 unit of time to complete and only one job can be scheduled at a time. We earn the profit if and only if the job is completed by its deadline. The task is to find the number of jobs done and the maximum profit.

Note: Jobs will be given in the form (Jobid, Deadline, Profit) associated with that Job.
Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
Jobs = {(1,4,20),(2,1,10),(3,1,40),(4,1,30)}
Output:
2 60
Explanation:
Job1 and Job3 can be done with
maximum profit of 60 (20+40).
Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
Jobs = {(1,2,100),(2,1,19),(3,2,27),
        (4,1,25),(5,1,15)}
Output:
2 127
Explanation:
2 jobs can be done with
maximum profit of 127 (100+27).
Your Task :
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function JobScheduling() which takes an integer N and an array of Jobs(Job id, Deadline, Profit) as input and returns an array ans[ ] in which ans[0] contains the count of jobs and ans[1] contains maximum profit.

Expected Time Complexity: O(NlogN)
Expected Auxilliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= Deadline <= 100
1 <= Profit <= 500
