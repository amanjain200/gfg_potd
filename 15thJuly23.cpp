Given a stack, delete the middle element of the stack without using any additional data structure.
Middle element:- ceil((size_of_stack+1)/2) (1-based indexing) from bottom of the stack.

Note: The output shown by the compiler is the stack from top to bottom.
 
Example 1:

Input: 
Stack = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
Output:
ModifiedStack = {10, 20, 40, 50}
Explanation:
If you print the stack the bottom-most element will be 10 and the top-most element will be 50. Middle element will be element at index 3 from bottom, which is 30. Deleting 30, stack will look like {10 20 40 50}.

Example 2:

Input: 
Stack = {10 20 30 40}
Output:
ModifiedStack = {10 30 40}
Explanation:
If you print the stack the bottom-most element will be 10 and the top-most element will be 40. Middle element will be element at index 2 from bottom, which is 20. Deleting 20, stack will look like {10 30 40}.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function deleteMid() which takes the stack and its size as input parameters and modifies the stack in-place.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
2 ≤ size of stack ≤ 105
