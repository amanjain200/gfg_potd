Given a number and its reverse. Find that number raised to the power of its own reverse.
Note: As answers can be very large, print the result modulo 109 + 7.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 2, R = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The reverse of 2 is 2 and after raising power of 2 by 2 we get 4 which gives remainder as 4 when divided by 1000000007.

Example 2:

Input:
N = 12, R = 21
Output: 864354781
Explanation: The reverse of 12 is 21and 1221 when divided by 1000000007 gives remainder as 864354781.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. You just need to complete the function pow() that takes two parameters N and R denoting the input number and its reverse and returns power of (N to R)mod(109 + 7).

Expected Time Complexity: O(LogN).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(LogN).

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 109
