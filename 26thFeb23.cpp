Given an undirected graph with V vertices(numbered from 1 to V) and E edges. Find the number of good components in the graph.
A component of the graph is good if and only if the component is a fully connected component.
Note: A fully connected component is a subgraph of a given graph such that there's an edge between every pair of vertices in a component, the given graph can be a disconnected graph. Consider the adjacency list from index 1.

Example 1:

Input: 

Output: 1
Explanation: We can see that there is only one 
component in the graph and in this component 
there is a edge between any two vertces.
Example 2:

Input:

Output: 2
Explanation: We can see that there are 3 components
in the graph. For 1-2-7 there is no edge between
1 to 7, so it is not a fully connected component.
Rest 2 are individually fully connected component.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function
findNumberOfGoodComponent() which takes an integer V and an adjacency list adj as input parameters and returns an integer denoting the number of good components.

Expected Time Complexity: O(V+E)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(depth of the graph)

Constraints:
1 ≤ V, E ≤ 104
